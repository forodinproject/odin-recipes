    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cake pop is a cake ball (baked cake rolled into balls and dipped in candy coating) on a stick to resemble a lollipop. Though cake pops existed before the coffee chain's version, the bite-sized dessert experienced a surge in popularity after Starbucks added them to its menu in 2011.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package yellow cake mix</li>
        <li>1cup water</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>half cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 contained prepared chocolate forsting</li>
        <li>18 lollipop sticks</li>
        <li>1 bag chocolate candy melts</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon multicolored candy sprinkles, or as needed (Optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li> Beat cake mix, water, oil, and eggs in a bowl using an electric mixer on low speed for 30 seconds. Increase speed to medium and beat for 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li> Pour batter into the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 28 to 33 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool completely, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li> Crumble cooled cake into a large bowl.</li>
        <li> Stir frosting into the crumbled cake until mixture is sticky and starts to come together but is not too smooth. Refrigerate until chilled, for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li> Roll cake mixture into eighteen 1 1/2-inch balls and place on a baking sheet.</li>
        <li> Place about 1/4 cup candy melts in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on high until melted, about 20 seconds. </li>
        <li> Push a lollipop stick halfway into each ball of cake mixture.</li>
        <li> Gently dip balls into the melted chocolate to coat, then place upright in a block of styrofoam.</li>
        <li> Decorate with candy sprinkles while chocolate coating is wet. Repeat to make remaining cake pops, melting more candy melts as needed.</li>
        
    </ol>
